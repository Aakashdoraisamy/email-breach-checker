# 🔐 Password Breach Checker

A simple Python + Flask web application that checks if your **password** has been exposed in known data breaches, using the [Have I Been Pwned - Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Secure password check**: Checks whether your password has been involved in a known breach.

- 🌐 **Minimal web UI**: Built with **Flask**, using HTML and CSS in a single file for a lightweight frontend.
- ⚙️ **Clean structure**: Backend (`app.py`) separated from UI (`templates/index.html`).
